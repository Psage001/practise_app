Here's a revised version of your README for the "Roll Dice" Flutter app:

---

# Roll Dice Flutter App

This is a simple dice-rolling application built using Flutter. The app features a dynamic UI with a background gradient and allows users to roll dice, displaying random results. The app demonstrates the use of both stateful and stateless widgets in Flutter, making it a great starting point for beginners.

## Features
- **Stateful Dice Rolling**: The app includes a dice widget that changes its state each time the dice is rolled.
- **Custom Gradient Background**: A stateless widget is used to display a visually appealing background gradient.
- **User Interaction**: Tap or click to roll the dice and generate new random values.
  
## Project Structure

- **`main.dart`**: The entry point of the application. It sets up the basic structure and initializes the necessary widgets.
  
- **`gradient.dart`**: A stateless widget responsible for rendering a background gradient, providing the app with a clean and modern look.

- **`roll_dice.dart`**: A stateful widget that contains the core logic for rolling the dice and updating the UI with random values on each roll.
